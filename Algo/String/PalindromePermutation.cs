    * Given a string, check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
    * Check is case insensitive.
    * Example: TactCoa should return true because it has permutations: "tacocat", "atcocta", which are palindromes.
    * Of course, it is impossible to generate all permutations of a string and test if it is a palindrome one by one.
    * To solve this, create a character map, with key is the characters of the string and value is the occurence of the character.
    * If the string is a permutation of a palindrome, it must have at most one character that has appeared in the string odd-number times.
